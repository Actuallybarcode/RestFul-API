Restful API Work 1.0.0

Use Postman to get the Stuff, I've added the UUID's libary, from the React.js App, I need to rework most of the code included with the Stuff on the Express Server

I'll include the "users" file, on 1/7/22 Update, for Reworking information along sided mongodb.


**To Start the Server**
node index.js

**INSTALL POSTMAN, NODE.JS, EXPRESS**

The information provided avoids the server from crashing at Random-Rates, make sure to include Propor Security Fixes, to avoid Data-RTC Leak.
